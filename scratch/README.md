### These are my notes that I have taken over the past few months of this project
*Originally this was going to be an VR project however I switched to AR for personal reasons and for XR this is my preference. At first, I was going to create a island simulation that could be viewed by all in a room and this was going to be deployed on the Magic Leap 1. However, there were some issues with the Magic Leap documentation  and wnat version of Unity would be useed for the project. It was impossible to follow the online tutorials because Unity and the Magic Laep SDK has been rapidly been evolving in the pass year or so. It was also my thinking that using a less expensinve and lighter device would be more appropriate for the project especially when I abruptly decided my island was going to be a battleship game. Hence, the Nreal Light came in with a cost of 500 bucks from Versizon. Interestingly, the Nreal SDK is currently not overly complex and has much to offer. This is what lead me to start creating Island Wars AR.

The pdf document in this directory, has all these thought and scribbles that lend to this concept and I feel it is important to preserve this.
