##### > *Today, Eight Forty Six Studio released a new augmented reality game designed to be played*
##### *on Nreal's low cost AR glasses. The glasses can easily be picked up*
##### *for around 500 bucks at your local Verizon store. The game is an interesting concept* 
##### *in that two players can interact together in any space while playing the game.*
##### *Traditional video games lack any real human interaction when it comes to playing a game with another*
##### *player. However, Island Wars nails this and creates an experience where both players can*
##### *see, talk, and communicate while playing outside or in a room.*

##### > *This game will change the way we interact while gaming. Using low cost commercial augmented*
##### *glasses, Eight Forty Six gets it just right. When we played the prototype we were amazed at how far* 
##### *technology has come where we can play or be in an extended reality (XR) world with harware that*
##### *weights about three ounces. In the past, the only way to create interactive XR was to use bulky*
##### *headsets that weight a few pounds and thats not mentioning having a consumer put down 2,500 to*
##### *3,500 dollars just to see if this is something they might like. Additionally, setting up the* 
##### *headsets was also comlex. The beauty about the system that Eight Forty Six used is that setup* 
##### *and onboarding is as simple downloading an application from Google play store, plugging a phone*  
##### *into the glasses, choosing an XR style, and selecting the application you want to play.*

##### > *This game concept really shines as it pits two players fighting each other in a battleship*
##### *format where you fly a floating island that is armed to the teeth and manuever around a room*
##### *using just your phone. There were various weapon options and well as resource management.*
##### *The arena was interesting and allowed for multiple strategies to be used to defeat your enemy*
##### *as you navigate around hazards and barriers. What I would have liked was for this studio*
##### *to have some options to set the size of the arena, but it understandable they they did not*
##### *because it is still in aplha. All in all, this game shows promise and we can't wait to see*
##### *the final product.*
