#####      *Today Eight Forty Six Studio release a new augmented reality designed to be played*
##### *on Nreal's low cost augmented reality glasses. The glasses can easily be picked up*
##### *for around 500 bucks at your local Verizon store. The game is an interesting concept* 
##### *in that tow player can interact together in any space while playing the game.*

##### *Eight Forty Six gets it just right. When we played the prototype we were amazed at how far 
#####  technology has come where we can play or be in an extended reality (XR) world with harware that
#####  weights about three ounces. In the past, the only way to create interactive XR was to use bulky
#####  headsets that weight a few pounds and thats not mentioning having a consumer put down 2,500 to
##### 3,500 dollars just to see if this is something they might like. Additionally, setting up the 
##### headsets was also comlex. The beauty about the system that Eight Forty Six used was that it is 
##### as simple downloading an application from the Google play store, plugging in the glasses to 
##### your phone, choosing an XR style, and selecting the application you want to play.*
