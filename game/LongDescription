### Long description: Two floating islands engage each other by navigating an arena filled with obstacles. Additionally, Islands can extract resources for thrust, health, and advancing their tech tree. Islands also fall into categories and can have weapon customization. For the demo there are two classes. A torpedo class and a tesla class. The Environment can help or hurt each island and how a player uses this mechanic to their advantage can determine the outcome of the battle. Phases have been included in this document and the current priority is movement and arena development. Phase 2 will be resource management and weapon interactions.
